15. Always create a pull request from a **branch** other than `main`.

## üìçOther points to remember while submitting your work:

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

- If LED Blinking is submitted, for example, the Folder Name should be "LED Blinking" and the File Name as "led_blinking.c" and will be pushed into the appropriate repository.
- File extension for code should be `.py` or `.c` or `.cpp` etc.. 
- Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name, as it will be easy to parse in future using scripts.
- Please avoid creating new directories if at all possible. Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure you have created for your project. If you want to, please contact me before doing so.
- The [README.md] file should be concise and clear about what the script is about and what it does.
- It should be documented briefly enough to let readers understand. 
- If you have modified/added code work, make sure that code works before submitting.
- If you have modified/added documentation work, ensure your language is concise and contains no grammar errors.
- Follow the project structure.
